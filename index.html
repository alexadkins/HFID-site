					<a name="brief"><h2><b>PROJECT BRIEF</b></h2></a>
					<p>Our project addresses the dual issues that people who attend dining halls are unaware about the nutritional content and dining hall staff are often unaware what people like, want, and prefer. Our project will increase awareness for kitchen staff about what customers like and want. It will also help customers know the nutritional content in the food that they eat and enable them to easily improve their eating habits. Our project will improve nutritional awareness as users compare their eating habits with others’.</p>
					<p>In gathering information for our project, we will collect dining hall menus and the nutritional content of the meals served. We will talk to dining hall employees and contracted companies to gather this data. We will also need to collect information about the nutritional content of other foods, like snacks the user may eat or drink. There are many databases online that provide this general information. We will start our data gathering at Olin and Babson Colleges; we will talk to students and the employees of the companies that run these Colleges’ dining halls. We will also speak to workers within these dining halls and visit other cafeterias in different settings to better gauge what will be needed for our project.</p>
					<p>We will divide up tasks as necessary and according to our individual learning goals. We are all interested in learning interface design, so as we work on our project and determine tasks that need to be done we will divide them between us as interest dictates.</p>

              <h4>Dining Hall Apps <b> By Alex</b></h4>
              <p>There are several schools and universities that have created apps that tell the students what they can eat that day; these apps are in the same space of what we may be looking to do.</p>

              <h4>Outside Restaurant Menus <b> By Alex</b></h4>
              <p>Many restaurant post their menus outside of their establishment so that potential customers can look at decide whether they want to eat at the restaurant or not; this is a feature that dining halls tend to not have and we’ve heard a desire for this feature from interviewees.</p>

             <h4>Pop Up Notifications <b> By Jianhan</b></h4>
              <p>Pop-up notifications are used on phones to alert people when something important comes up. Since favorite foods can be somewhat rare to show up in dining halls, alerting people advising them to go the dining hall for a certain meal because their favorite foods are on the menu would be helpful since they would not have to check the menu themselves. Users can input which foods they like themselves or choose from the list of foods that have been served before in the dining hall. Once the setup is done, an application would check the dining hall menus for them before meal times and then notify the users that their favorite foods are available.</p>

              <h4>QR Codes <b> By Alex</b></h4>
              <p>QR Codes are a quick, easy, and common way of spreading and posting information. We would like to use these as inspiration to create an interface dining hall customers can use and be satisfied with.</p>

              <h4>Picture Frames <b> By Leo</b></h4>
              <p>Pictures frames are usually used at home to play your last vacation’s pictures but we could also use them in the dining hall by replacing the smalls cards that indicate the nutrition content of the dishes.</p>

              <h4>Activity Trackers <b> By Alex</b></h4>
              <p>Activity trackers keep track of a user’s daily amount of sleep and physical activity. This enables the user to know how healthy he or she is over a period of time, be it a day, weeks, or months. Knowing this data motivates a user to always do better and be healthier. The trackers themselves are very encouraging and often provide helpful tips on how to be healthier on a day to day basis.</p>
              <p>The daily interface that tells the user how well they slept and how many steps they’ve taken every day is very helpful for someone who is concerned with their health. The app lets the user know how proactive they have been that day and how far they are from accomplishing their daily goal. This is a useful feature for someone who wishes to eat healthily each day; they can keep track of what food they eat and whether it is good for them.</p>
              <p>The trends page of the app lets a user see their activity trends over time in days, weeks, or months. This is useful so that users can know what days of the week they are most active and when they get the best sleep. This is a feature we might want to implement for users who are interested in watching what they eat over a period of time. The scaling on this part of the app is inconsistent and flawed; it is be a feature we would need to improve.</p>

              <h4>Signal Tower <b> By Leo</b></h4>
              <p>One of our idea was to build a big tower signal that indicate if the Dining Hall is actually crowded or not. The inspirational design of this tower come from the traffic lights.</p>

              <h4>Coca Cola Multi-Flavor Machine <b> By Jianhan</b></h4>
              <p>Instead of selecting flavors to dispense, there can be a screen interface that lets people control what food and/or how much they want to serve. It would be for foods that are already cooked so it would be serving food and have information.</p>

              <h4>Traffic Tracker (gMaps) <b>By Jianhan</b></h4>
              <p>Google maps displays traffic information on different areas on roads to help people plan and choose the fastest way to get to a certain location. This could be applied to dining halls at the entrance and the various stations within so that people can check if the line is too long at any points where they want to go. People can choose to go to a dining hall later if the line at the entrance or their favorite station(s) is too long.</p>

              <h4>Drive Thru Menus <b> By Adit</b></h4>
              <p>One of the inspirational designs I had was fast food drive through menus. There are some key aspects of the design that could easily be useful in one of the ideas for our interface. Drive through menus are big, graphic displays of what food is available. Customers can easily see what food they want to eat. In addition, drive through menus give customers in a rush bigger things to see, while also including all the detail that is in the regular menu.</p>
              <p>One of our ideas that this inspiration applies to is creating a menu display at the front of the dining hall that you see before you pay for the food. A big and graphic display could help tell people what is the dining hall before they go in, and give people something to look at while they are standing in line. However, if we include all the details of the regular menu, you can create confusion with too much information, and create congestion in the line if people try to read all the details.</p>

              <h4>Physical Restaurant Menus <b> By Adit</b></h4>
              <p>When you are waiting to be seated at a restaurant, you can see the menu before being seated. In a dining hall with a long line, it could be useful to see the menu while waiting in line.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <h4>Foursquare <b> By Adit</b></h4>
              <p>Foursquare has an location based notifications, which connects to one of our ideas which is to do notifications if your favorite foods are in the dining hall.</p>

             <h4>Pie Charts <b> By Leo</b></h4>
              <p>We could use a pie chart to represent the nutrition content of a dish. This idea come from the pie graph we used in a survey; when there is a referendum we can see how much people in percentage of a population answer a specific question. A pie chart is divided into sectors, illustrating numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each sector (and consequently its central angle and area), is proportional to the quantity it represents. It is a great way to represent ideas of a specific population. They are used in politics to represent for example the seats of congress in France.</p>
