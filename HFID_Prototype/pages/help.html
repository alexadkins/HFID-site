	<h4>You're lost? Here is a recap of what you can do in this app :</h4>
		<p><strong>Choosing</strong> : you can vote (at least 2 days in advance) for the dish you'd prefer to eat in a few days. If it collects a majority of votes, it will appear on the menu.

		<p><strong>Menu</strong> : On this onglet you can see the menu of your Dining halls 
		</p>
		<p><strong>Feedback</strong>: There is a dish you'd like to see more often on the menu? A remark on the quality of food or even a proposition of event you'd like to see happen in the dining hall? write it here and the dining hall staff will read it and do the best they can to realize it. But remember, people are going to read it so don't be stupid, be nice :)
