	<p>Hi, We are 4 students from Olin College of Engineering and Babson university. We developed this app for an Olin' class : Human factor in Interface Design. This has been our main project for 4 months. </p>

	<p>Our team is composed by Alexandra Adkins, Adit Dhanushkodi, Jianhan Wang and Leo Thibaudat.
	</p>

	<p>Our project : we noticed that students usually talk about the food quality the Dining hall but only a few of them report their opinion to the staff. The main reason is that their is not a really efficient way to do it. So our idea is to give a more efficient and a quicker way to give feedback to the Dining Hall Staff. </p>

	</p>We've be through 4 differents prototypes and this is our final version.</p>

<br><br>

</p>we are really interested by your feedback (HAHA ! you get it?) so leave us a comment ! </p>
<p>Give us your impressions </p>
