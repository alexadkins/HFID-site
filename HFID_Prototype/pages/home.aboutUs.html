	<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;Hi, We are 4 students from Olin College of Engineering and Babson College. We developed this app for an Olin' class : <u>Human factor in Interface Design.</u> This has been our main project for 4 months. </p>

	<p><strong>Our Team </strong>: <div class = "namesCenter"> Alexandra Adkins<br> Adit Dhanushkodi<br> Jianhan Wang <br> Leo Thibaudat.
	</div></p>

	<p><strong>Our project</strong> : we noticed that students usually talk about the food quality the Dining hall but only a few of them report their opinion to the staff. The main reason is that their is not a really efficient way to do it. So our idea is to give a more efficient and a quicker way to give feedback to the Dining Hall Staff. </p>

	</p>We've be through 4 differents prototypes and this is our final version.</p>

	</p>We are really interested by your feedback (HAHA ! you get it?) so leave us a comment ! </p>
