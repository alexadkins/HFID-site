				<h2>PROTOTYPE REVISION</h2>
				<p>Based on feedback from the heuristic evaluation, which can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByUQjmh4k8L4VjdmTEpnN2ZVTnM/view?usp=sharing">here</a>, we made many changes to the design of our app. </p>
				<h3>Major Changes</h3>
				<p>For the next iteration of our prototype, we will be making it on to be web-based rather than using InvisionApp to increase functionality such as saving preference information. To address major heuristic evaluation violations, we will be implementing a tutorial to show inexperienced users how the setup/preferences screens function and what each of the 3 main features will allow users to do. Instead of organizing the home page by time and displaying the features by time of the meal, we will make navigation bar at the top that users can switch between the 3 features easily. We will also be removing confusing icons on the home page since they are difficult to understand for inexperienced users. As for the choosing feature of the app, we will be removing the expanding/collapsing feature because users did not care about what dish was originally planned by the dining hall. All 4 options for each of the 2 dishes for each meal will be shown by default. There will also be a submit vote(s) button that will show up at the top of the screen so that users will be less likely to make errors when voting and for inexperienced users, they will know that they have voted for a dish. After submitting votes, users will be able to see the results percentages with the choice that they voted for highlighted so that they can see that their vote mattered (vote count feature?), but will not be able to edit their votes. We do not want users to be biased by votes that have been casted already. As for the nutrition information, that will become a part of the menu feature, not the feedback or choosing features.</p>
				<h3>Minor Changes</h3>
				<p>As for more minor issues, we will be including an in-app text box for users to send feedback to the app developers. The dining hall name is placed at the top of the screen for each of the 3 main features. However, we will not be adding any additional labels that are repetitive to remind the user which dining hall they are giving feedback to. We will fix the descriptions of the setup screens so that inexperienced users can understand them well.</p>
				<h3>Future Changes</h3>
				<p>If we had more time to work on this, we would be including the nutrition information feature in the menu, responses screen from dining hall staff to let the user see how they are addressing feedback comments, and having dietary preferences affect which dishes show up on the menu and choosing pages.</p>

				<h2>FINAL REPORT</h2>
				<h3>The Problem</h3>
				<p>The ultimate goal of our project was to improve the cafeteria and dining hall experience. We determined, after conducting user research and gathering anecdotal evidence, that a significant area of opportunity we could pursue involved improving communication between customers and staff. We chose to improve the dining hall feedback experience with the creation an application that both enables users to choose what meals are served in the dining hall on a given day and gives them ease of access in giving feedback directly to the dining hall staff. </p>
				<h3>Our Solution</h3>
				<p>We arrived at this design solution after conducting extensive user research to discover concrete problems we could address. We learned that users did not give feedback to and often did not even speak with dining hall staff. Users felt the staff were intimidating and unapproachable. Feedback methods already in place, most commonly comment cards retrieved from the staff themselves, are ineffectual and often disregarded. Dining hall customers also believed that even if they did give feedback nothing would come of it. A user we interviewed told us he felt completely ignored when he gave feedback. 
				Our application solves these problems. The feedback feature enables users to easily and anonymously give feedback directly to the dining hall staff. Besides this, the quantity and honesty of the feedback given is increased, improving the staffâ€™s knowledge of the services they need to provide and improve. The choosing a meal feature of our application also gives customers an active hand in the dining hall process. Users feel validated as what they say has an observable and immediate effect. Individuals will also see their favorite meals served more often, further increasing satisfaction with the dining hall.</p>
				<h3>Design Justification</h3>
				<p>Each of the features of the app went through multiple design iterations. Below, we go through some of the specific design changes we made, and some of the design justification.</p>

			<div class="col-lg-7">
				<h4>Setup Screens</h4>
				<p>When a user logs into the app for the first time they are given the option of choosing what dining halls they want to know about and what dietary preferences or restrictions they have. This data persists throughout the app and influences what the user will access and see to optimize the experience to fit their needs. </p>

				<h4>Splash Screen</h4>
				<p>We considered after the comments on our heuristic evaluation to add an additional feature to points the different functionalities of the app because users were confused about what he/she can do on our previous prototype. After the usability test, the results were that this page really helped the user to orient him on the app the firsts time he comes to our app. Now the user has to go through this page when he enter the app, it also contain a brief description of the three functionalities, like a tutorial on how to use the app.</p>

			<div class="col-lg-7">
				<h4>Choosing</h4>
				<p>The design of this page is intended to allow users to quickly vote for alternative dishes that could be made with similar ingredients by the dining hall that the dining hall staff. This way, users can have a direct impact on their dining hall experience and see changes easily. The dining hall staff decide in advance what they are going to serve for the week, but small changes are not hard to do. On this prototype, we chose not to tell the user which dish the Dining hall is planning to serve. This remark came out from heuristic evaluation, The user did not understand why one meal was highlighted (the one that was supposed to be served).</p>

				<h4>Feedback</h4>
				<p>We let the choice of the user to specify the dish he would like to comment on so that the feedback can be easily interpreted and actionable by dining hall staff. It is not required and it allows dining hall staff to have more specific feedback. On our first prototype you could only access to the feedback page through a specific dish, but the heuristic evaluation revealed that people also want to give general comments and improvements propositions so now they can do it.</p>
