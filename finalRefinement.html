				<h2>PROTOTYPE REVISION</h2>
				<p>Based on feedback from the heuristic evaluation, which can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByUQjmh4k8L4VjdmTEpnN2ZVTnM/view?usp=sharing">here</a>, we made many changes to the design of our app. </p>
				<h3>Major Changes</h3>
				<p>For the next iteration of our prototype, we will be making it on to be web-based rather than using InvisionApp to increase functionality such as saving preference information. To address major heuristic evaluation violations, we will be implementing a tutorial to show inexperienced users how the setup/preferences screens function and what each of the 3 main features will allow users to do. Instead of organizing the home page by time and displaying the features by time of the meal, we will make navigation bar at the top that users can switch between the 3 features easily. We will also be removing confusing icons on the home page since they are difficult to understand for inexperienced users. As for the choosing feature of the app, we will be removing the expanding/collapsing feature because users did not care about what dish was originally planned by the dining hall. All 4 options for each of the 2 dishes for each meal will be shown by default. There will also be a submit vote(s) button that will show up at the top of the screen so that users will be less likely to make errors when voting and for inexperienced users, they will know that they have voted for a dish. After submitting votes, users will be able to see the results percentages with the choice that they voted for highlighted so that they can see that their vote mattered (vote count feature?), but will not be able to edit their votes. We do not want users to be biased by votes that have been casted already. As for the nutrition information, that will become a part of the menu feature, not the feedback or choosing features.</p>
				<h3>Minor Changes</h3>
				<p>As for more minor issues, we will be including an in-app text box for users to send feedback to the app developers. The dining hall name is placed at the top of the screen for each of the 3 main features. However, we will not be adding any additional labels that are repetitive to remind the user which dining hall they are giving feedback to. We will fix the descriptions of the setup screens so that inexperienced users can understand them well.</p>
				<h3>Future Changes</h3>
				<p>If we had more time to work on this, we would be including the nutrition information feature in the menu, responses screen from dining hall staff to let the user see how they are addressing feedback comments, and having dietary preferences affect which dishes show up on the menu and choosing pages.</p>

				<h2>FINAL REPORT</h2>
				<h3>The Problem</h3>
				<p>The ultimate goal of our project was to improve the cafeteria and dining hall experience. We determined, after conducting user research and gathering anecdotal evidence, that a significant area of opportunity we could pursue involved improving communication between customers and staff. We chose to improve the dining hall feedback experience with the creation an application that both enables users to choose what meals are served in the dining hall on a given day and gives them ease of access in giving feedback directly to the dining hall staff. </p>
