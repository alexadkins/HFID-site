				<h2>PROBLEM OVERVIEW</h2>
        		<p> We chose to confront the issue of poor feedback mechanisms in dining halls and cafeterias. Dining hall customers find it difficult to leave feedback on meals and service, and dining hall staff often do not know the issues that customers are having with the services the staff provide. Customers resort to either leaving no feedback or feel awkward when asking for (generally ineffective) comment cards directly from the staff they are looking to criticize. When the staff does receive feedback it is often a challenge to implement changes and provide solid, observable results. This results in low motivation to give feedback to dining halls.</p>
        		<p>We chose to confront the dining hall process in proactive way; instead of focusing on the feedback a customer might give about the meals they have eaten after the fact, our design’s main purpose is to enable the user to have a preemptive way of deciding what foods will be served at the dining hall daily, thus providing the user with an immediate and observable change in the dining hall procedure as well as reducing negative feedback after the fact due to unwanted and unliked meals. We also implemented a feature so a user may give feedback retroactively on past meals. This lowers the barrier of entry and awkwardness for giving criticism to the meals the dining hall produces. Finally, we included a menu feature, so that users may easily know what will be in the dining hall besides what they have chosen for themselves. </p>

				<h2>OVERALL DESIGN</h2>
				<img style="width:100%" src="assets/img/images/prototype3.png">
				<br></br>
				<p>Above is the latest design of our interface. This design is the result of three iterations of paper prototypes, which are extensively documented in the Appendix below. In this version, there are three main features listed in order of priority: 1) Preemptive Menu Choosing 2) Reflective Feedback and 3) Menu Viewing.</p>
				<p>The <b>preemtive dish choosing feature</b> allows the user to help decide what dishes are going to be available in the future. It helps include students in the menu creation process. Specifically, this feature ties to the Concerned Christy’s need for healthy eating options. Instead of giving feedback after the fact, this feature allows Christy to ensure that healthy options will already be in the dining hall.</p>
				<p>The <b>reflective feedback</b> feature allows the user to give feedback on dishes he or she already ate. Currently, this type of feedback is only given through word of mouth directly to dining hall staff, or not all. This feature helps students like Restricted Rachel share her opinions of the dining hall to people who can actually make change, and students like Concerned Christy, who are quiet and don’t necessarily talk to dining hall staff regularly. </p>
				<p>Finally, the <b>menu viewing feature</b>, which is a lower priority feature of the app, allows the user to quickly view dishes and nutrition info on the dishes. This connects to Concerned Christy’s need to know she is eating healthy, and Restricted Rachel’s value of knowledge, and knowing what meals are available, before getting into the dining hall. </p>
				<h3>Why an App?</h3>
				<p>We decided to implement our idea as a smart device application. We wanted our design to be easily accessible and quick to use. Using a specialized app enables low activation energy of use for smartphone users. It allows users to choose their meals and give feedback on the go or in the dining hall, perhaps before beginning or finishing a meal, when they are most likely to have their opinions on their minds. A device within the dining hall itself could either become crowded or be easily ignored; busy users would also have to take the extra time to stand in one location or make their friends wait for them while they fill out the necessary information. A computer interface would make the user either wait until they had returned to their dorms or pull out their computer in the dining hall itself, the prior of which would be significant time after the meals, allowing the user to forget they were going to give feedback, and the prior is simply inconvenient. Because most customers at college/university dining halls have and carry smart phones, our app would be easily and quickly accessible and carry them with them all the time, so this would allow them to quickly access it.</p>

				<h2>FLOW DIAGRAM</h2>
				<p>The flow diagram for our prototype 1.2 is shown below. The same flow is maintained in the final paper prototype. Because the purpose of the app is primary feedback based, the flow of the app is also centered around the main feedback pages. The menu feature is tucked away, still easily accesible, but less integrated with the overall flow of the app. </p>

				<h3>Homepage/Menu Choosing</h3>
				<p>The screen plays the focus role in our application. Customers in dining halls need easy ways to get feedback to dining halls and see it affect their experience at the dining halls. We wanted our app to allow users to give feedback on past items as well as directly impact the future with choosing of dishes appearing in the dining hall. If customers see that what they are doing makes a difference in the service that dining halls provide to them, they would have a strong enough benefit to continually use the application.</p>
				<p>This screen acts as the starting point to quickly interact with the features of voting for dishes in the future, giving feedback, and viewing the menu. The latter two are completed on other screens while voting for dishes can be accomplished in the same screen. The first two are the main features of our application. Since we would be including the menu anyway for the feedback component of our app which allows users to give actionable feedback on specific dishes, we allowed the option to view the menu for meals in the future before dishes can be voted on. After users vote, we saw that we needed something to indicate that their vote was confirmed and the current results. Showing this after the user votes helps reduce any bias of going with the majority.</p>
				<p>This screen contains information about the days of the week and where the user can quickly give his/her input to a dining hall. On the top, it has the dining hall selected, centered. The sidebar button is at the top left and the ability to access the full menu toward the right as well as which week it is. The week dates were chosen given how the dining hall posts their menu currently, but this will be changed to identify the current day along with the date in the list for a cleaner interface. The see full menu with the text is a placeholder for an icon. For the meals of the week that have gone past already, the give feedback button appears, which opens up a menu with feedback buttons for dishes. We made the assumption for now that dining halls require 2 days advance notice to make any changes to the way they prepare a dish, so we are letting users vote for their preferred dishes 2 days ahead of the current day. To keep the screen less cluttered, we are allowing users to vote for variations of 2 dishes per meal for lunch and dinner. In this effort toward a clean and quick-to-use interface, we choose not to go forward with interface designs that used more screen real estate with little additional benefit: up and down voting and pictures of dishes. Designs with two columns of choices also did not progress forward to keep consistency with the interface of the rest of the application and provide a cleaner look. We realize that by putting meal 1 and 2 first, we are giving those options more priority than nA, nB, and nC choices which are in the drop down portion. The drop down is used so that users do not have to keep all options expanded all of the time. Check boxes are used to vote for the dishes and the user can only for one option per dish. They can change their votes before the voting period ends by choosing a different option for each dish. Votes are automatically submitted. For meals in the future before 2 days in the future, there are buttons linked to see the full menu for those meals. After voting, a glowing right arrow pops up which is linked to a screen containing the results page for the meals that they voted on so far. It would fit the same screen height to keep it fluid.</p>

				<h3>Reflective Feedback</h3>
				<p>The reflective feedback feature of the app also plays a large role in the overall app, but a little less so than the menu choosing feature. From prototype 0 to prototype 1.3, many changes were made from the user testing and feedback we got. When you click on give feedback from the homepage, you are taken to the first page, which maps all the dishes to locations in the actual dining hall. Tapping on any category lets you see all the dishes. One of the major changes we made to this screen was to combine it with the menu screen. While both screens served different purposes, they both displayed the same information. It made logical sense to combine the screens. </p>
				<p>By each dish, there are two choices: nutrition and feedback. Initially, we also had a quick star rating system by each dish too, but realized from user testing that this information would be useless for the dining hall staff to make changes from, since different students had different reasons for rating a dish poorly or well.</p>
				<p>Other features that exist within this page is the ability to open all dishes quickly, and search fuctionality, to find dishes, sorted by closest time served. Search functionality did not exist in the first prototypes, and came out of user feedback that showed that some users didn't remember where they picked up the dish from the dining hall, so they couldn't easily find the dish in the app. </p>

					<h3>Welcome Screen</h3>
					<p>The welcome screen serves as the entry point into the app for the user. It gives a small overview of the purpose of the app and gives the user context for what they can do within our app. It is a starting point that will be the first step in guiding the user through their initial use of our design.
					</p>
					<p> This screen is important in giving context to the user of what they are trying to accomplish, but it is not a major feature. It is simply an access point to the real substance of our app.
					</p>
					<p>The welcome screen is very simple but did undergo more than one design rendition. We initially simply had “Welcome,” with two boxes, one for a domain username and another for the user’s domain password, for login into the app. When we were doing user testing it became apparent that logging in with the enter button on the keyboard after entering the username and password confuses a lot of people. Therefore, we had to add a log in button. The welcome screen initially did not contain information about the app at all, so users did not know what it was about or what to expect from it.</p>

				</div><!-- col-lg-6 -->
				<div class="col-lg-7">
					<h3>Setup Screens</h3>
					<p>We created setup screens to customize the experience for users based on relevant information to them. The two major parts that we found important are which dining halls users go to and any dietary restrictions that they have since labels at dining halls can be inaccurate and mislead them to eating unwanted foods. 
					</p>
					<p> These two screens are primarily used during initial setup since there would be few scenarios when users would need to change the dining halls that they eat at and what they can eat. After the initial setup, users would not be frequently accessing the two screens unless they choose to from the sidebar.
					</p>
					<p>The screen was designed to allow users to choose any restrictions or unwanted items that they might have. Since dining hall labels are not always accurate, selecting these would help prevent customers from eating restricted items.
					</p>
					<p>The popular restricted diets are listed first, with allergies and unwanted foods following afterwards, being more customized. Each item on the list can be checked so that the user knows that they can selected multiple options, not just one. At the top, the title of the screen is centered with a button to access the sidebar at the left to keep consistency with other screens. The “done” button is placed at the center bottom part of the screen as a translucent overlay so that users can see that the list is scrollable if more options are added in the future. The etc. part with the + to the right of it shows that for more allergies, users can tap + and expand the list, reinforcing the scroll-ability of the screen.</p>
					<p>Alternative designs included more options for allergies/unwanted ingredients, but we decided against that since our main focus for the application is not showing what foods that users can eat. We added this to generally address the needs of the majority.
					</p>

				<div class="col-lg-5 centered">

				</div><!-- col-lg-6 -->
				<div class="col-lg-7">
					<h3>Sidebar</h3>
					<p>There was a significant quantity of discussion concerning whether to include nutritional information within this application. A preliminary application idea included a daily nutritional intake tracker which was disregarded as an idea for further development because of the low value alignment it held with our users. It was this concern and the potential of adding too much clutter and unwanted information that was the drive behind some of our discussion on whether to include nutritional information. However, we had to consider that a considerable focus of our design is on menu information which is, today, often accompanied by nutritional information, regularly be legal requirement. The dining halls our application focuses on surely have nutritional information displayed and readily available, so there was at least a minimum requirement for nutritional information. Thus, while nutritional information is not a focus in our app, it must exist. This is the motivation behind the small and unobtrusive button that will yield the nutritional information of a meal.
					</p>
					<p> The reason behind making the nutritional information a pop-up was for both consistent design cohesion and for quick and simple navigation. The feedback button next the the nutritional information button also yields a pop-up; we wanted a predictable result from both buttons. We decided both the feedback and nutritional information screens would be overlay pop-up windows because of the impression that a user is not actually navigating away from the previous process (the dining hall menu) but merely taking a quick sojourn to conduct a simple task. It would be detrimental to switch screens and context entirely because the user will be returning to the menu almost immediately.
					</p>
					<p>Finally, the design behind the nutritional information pop-up itself underwent a couple of renditions. Because a nutritional tracker idea had existed and been sketched, several of the display ideas had carried over to this other application design. A previous rendition included information displayed in potentially several complex pie charts and other display methods. When we reconsidered this screen, and how it plays a minor role in the overall utility of our application, we redesigned for a more simple layout that follows the common convention of nutritional info displays. It is familiar, uncomplicated, and reflects the role is plays in our overall design. 
					</p>

				<div class="col-lg-7">
					<h3>Nutrition</h3>
					<p>This sidebar role is a kind of an option menu. We can see on the top the account name of the user, he can change his dietary preferences and his favorites Dining halls. He also have the possibility to add some Dining halls if he wants. There is also a button “about us” that when we tap on it will explain the user what we are trying to achieve with this app and why. The last button is an “help” button that explain the user how to use the app (e.g. : explain that he cannot choose dishes for the day after because the dining hall will not have enough time to change the menu etc…)
					</p>
					<p> This screen is not the one that the user will use the most so it’s not a major player of this app however it is essential to the good understanding of the app. The user can switch dining hall by tapping on it or even add one by tapping the little “+” at the end of the list. We chose the “+” sign because it is a worldwide sign that everybody understand. We chose to use tapping button for all the options that offer this sidebar (Dietary preferences, About us and Help)  because all of them are redirecting to another screen of the app and also this is the simplest way to do it.  Our sidebar is going to be accessible from anywhere in the app by tapping the three straight lines on the top left of the screen.
					</p>
					<p>The alternative design we draw are quite similar of the one we propose because the frame is simple and the possibilities of buttons are restricted. The main misunderstanding that the user encounter is the My Diet button. S(he) was confused about what does it meant so we changed the text in “My dietary Preferences”.
