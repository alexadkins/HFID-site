				<h2>PROBLEM OVERVIEW</h2>
        		<p> We chose to confront the issue of poor feedback mechanisms in dining halls and cafeterias. Dining hall customers find it difficult to leave feedback on meals and service, and dining hall staff often do not know the issues that customers are having with the services the staff provide. Customers resort to either leaving no feedback or feel awkward when asking for (generally ineffective) comment cards directly from the staff they are looking to criticize. When the staff does receive feedback it is often a challenge to implement changes and provide solid, observable results. This results in low motivation to give feedback to dining halls.</p>
        		<p>We chose to confront the dining hall process in proactive way; instead of focusing on the feedback a customer might give about the meals they have eaten after the fact, our design’s main purpose is to enable the user to have a preemptive way of deciding what foods will be served at the dining hall daily, thus providing the user with an immediate and observable change in the dining hall procedure as well as reducing negative feedback after the fact due to unwanted and unliked meals. We also implemented a feature so a user may give feedback retroactively on past meals. This lowers the barrier of entry and awkwardness for giving criticism to the meals the dining hall produces. Finally, we included a menu feature, so that users may easily know what will be in the dining hall besides what they have chosen for themselves. </p>

				<h2>APPENDIX</h2>
				<p>Through this phase of the project, we have been through four iterations of designs. Each design is listed in this appendix. In addition, we have done extensive design development on each individual screen. Our design choices are summarized below.</p>

					<h3>Welcome Screen</h3>
					<p>The welcome screen serves as the entry point into the app for the user. It gives a small overview of the purpose of the app and gives the user context for what they can do within our app. It is a starting point that will be the first step in guiding the user through their initial use of our design.
					</p>
					<p> This screen is important in giving context to the user of what they are trying to accomplish, but it is not a major feature. It is simply an access point to the real substance of our app.
					</p>
					<p>The welcome screen is very simple but did undergo more than one design rendition. We initially simply had “Welcome,” with two boxes, one for a domain username and another for the user’s domain password, for login into the app. When we were doing user testing it became apparent that logging in with the enter button on the keyboard after entering the username and password confuses a lot of people. Therefore, we had to add a log in button. The welcome screen initially did not contain information about the app at all, so users did not know what it was about or what to expect from it.</p>

				</div><!-- col-lg-6 -->
				<div class="col-lg-7">
					<h3>Setup Screens</h3>
					<p>We created setup screens to customize the experience for users based on relevant information to them. The two major parts that we found important are which dining halls users go to and any dietary restrictions that they have since labels at dining halls can be inaccurate and mislead them to eating unwanted foods. 
					</p>
					<p> These two screens are primarily used during initial setup since there would be few scenarios when users would need to change the dining halls that they eat at and what they can eat. After the initial setup, users would not be frequently accessing the two screens unless they choose to from the sidebar.
					</p>
					<p>The screen was designed to allow users to choose any restrictions or unwanted items that they might have. Since dining hall labels are not always accurate, selecting these would help prevent customers from eating restricted items.
					</p>
					<p>The popular restricted diets are listed first, with allergies and unwanted foods following afterwards, being more customized. Each item on the list can be checked so that the user knows that they can selected multiple options, not just one. At the top, the title of the screen is centered with a button to access the sidebar at the left to keep consistency with other screens. The “done” button is placed at the center bottom part of the screen as a translucent overlay so that users can see that the list is scrollable if more options are added in the future. The etc. part with the + to the right of it shows that for more allergies, users can tap + and expand the list, reinforcing the scroll-ability of the screen.</p>
					<p>Alternative designs included more options for allergies/unwanted ingredients, but we decided against that since our main focus for the application is not showing what foods that users can eat. We added this to generally address the needs of the majority.

					<h3>Sidebar</h3>
					<p>There was a significant quantity of discussion concerning whether to include nutritional information within this application. A preliminary application idea included a daily nutritional intake tracker which was disregarded as an idea for further development because of the low value alignment it held with our users. It was this concern and the potential of adding too much clutter and unwanted information that was the drive behind some of our discussion on whether to include nutritional information. However, we had to consider that a considerable focus of our design is on menu information which is, today, often accompanied by nutritional information, regularly be legal requirement. The dining halls our application focuses on surely have nutritional information displayed and readily available, so there was at least a minimum requirement for nutritional information. Thus, while nutritional information is not a focus in our app, it must exist. This is the motivation behind the small and unobtrusive button that will yield the nutritional information of a meal.
					</p>
					<p> The reason behind making the nutritional information a pop-up was for both consistent design cohesion and for quick and simple navigation. The feedback button next the the nutritional information button also yields a pop-up; we wanted a predictable result from both buttons. We decided both the feedback and nutritional information screens would be overlay pop-up windows because of the impression that a user is not actually navigating away from the previous process (the dining hall menu) but merely taking a quick sojourn to conduct a simple task. It would be detrimental to switch screens and context entirely because the user will be returning to the menu almost immediately.
					</p>
					<p>Finally, the design behind the nutritional information pop-up itself underwent a couple of renditions. Because a nutritional tracker idea had existed and been sketched, several of the display ideas had carried over to this other application design. A previous rendition included information displayed in potentially several complex pie charts and other display methods. When we reconsidered this screen, and how it plays a minor role in the overall utility of our application, we redesigned for a more simple layout that follows the common convention of nutritional info displays. It is familiar, uncomplicated, and reflects the role is plays in our overall design.

					<h3>Nutrition</h3>
					<p>This sidebar role is a kind of an option menu. We can see on the top the account name of the user, he can change his dietary preferences and his favorites Dining halls. He also have the possibility to add some Dining halls if he wants. There is also a button “about us” that when we tap on it will explain the user what we are trying to achieve with this app and why. The last button is an “help” button that explain the user how to use the app (e.g. : explain that he cannot choose dishes for the day after because the dining hall will not have enough time to change the menu etc…)
					</p>
					<p> This screen is not the one that the user will use the most so it’s not a major player of this app however it is essential to the good understanding of the app. The user can switch dining hall by tapping on it or even add one by tapping the little “+” at the end of the list. We chose the “+” sign because it is a worldwide sign that everybody understand. We chose to use tapping button for all the options that offer this sidebar (Dietary preferences, About us and Help)  because all of them are redirecting to another screen of the app and also this is the simplest way to do it.  Our sidebar is going to be accessible from anywhere in the app by tapping the three straight lines on the top left of the screen.
					</p>
					<p>The alternative design we draw are quite similar of the one we propose because the frame is simple and the possibilities of buttons are restricted. The main misunderstanding that the user encounter is the My Diet button. S(he) was confused about what does it meant so we changed the text in “My dietary Preferences”.
