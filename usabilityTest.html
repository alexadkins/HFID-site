				<h2>HYPOTHESIS</h2>
				<p>In the current design of the app, the welcome/explanation frame (left) appears before the main content of the app (right). We hypothesize that having this introduction screen will improve the users&#39; understanding of how the choosing feature works as well as our users&#39; understanding of the app entirely.</p>
				
				<br>
				<img style="width:100%" src="assets/img/images/usabilityTest-1stscreen-vs-noscreen.jpg" alt="Descriptive Screen and Main Page">
				<br>
				
				<h2>Independent Variables</h2>
				<h3>Experimental Conditions</h3>
				<p>We will vary the showing of the left frame. One set of users will see the left frame before seeing the frame on the right. The other set of users will start at the frame on the right.</p>
				<h3>Consistency and Changes</h3>
				<p>All the other frames of our app will be the same, we will try one time showing the user the first frame ( the one on the left) and one time without to see if the response time change from one another. If it does, it would mean that this front page affect the user experience and understanding of the app. Depending on the results of these test, we will confirm our first hypothesis or refute it. Both sets of users will be asked to vote for two dishes on one certain day. Users may choose to see different screens than each other, but they have access to all of the same screens, except the one group who does not begin by seeing the descriptive screen on the left.</p>
				
				<h2>Response Variables</h2>
				<p>We will record the time it takes for a user to vote for 2 dishes after weâ€™ve requested that they accomplish this task. The user will attempt this with two different application designs. We are choosing to have the test user vote twice so we know that they are not randomly pressing buttons and accidentally vote by chance.</p>
				
				<h2>Expected Response in Variables</h2>
				<p>We would expect the inexperienced user to take less time to figure out how to vote for a dish and complete the task with our updated design, and for them to take longer with the previous design. We also anticipate the user completing the second round of voting quicker, as they will have gained familiarity with the app. Qualitatively, we hope to observe less confusion in the purpose and usage of our design.</p>
				
				<h2>Ideal Test Conditions</h2>
				<p>Ideally, we would have tests with at least 20-100 inexperienced users split into two equal groups in testing the usefulness of the explanation screen for first-time users. These users would be given the same interfaces at the same time and recorded with a camera and timer.</p>
				<p>We would also test the user&#39;s understanding of the swiping gesture. We chose to swipe the screen to go to the next meal menu but we don&#39;t know yet how the user might react. To test this reaction, we would start with just an arrow that would get the user to the next meal. We would then implement the swiping gesture and integrate a small tutorial to explain the user how it works for the first time. Depending on the behavior of the user (hesitating or confident) we would adapt our solution to our results. If our test users are confident about it, we would consider dropping the tutorial.</p>
