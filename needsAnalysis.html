				<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
				<p>We started brainstorming issues that we could design an interface for to solve. We then arrived in the dining hall space based on personal interest and came up with a variety of potential issues. After talking to dining hall customers, we found several issues.</p>
				<p>Our user research shows that, for many dining hall customers, knowing what food is in the dining hall beforehand is critical to that user’s decision to even eat at that location either due to dietary or monetary restrictions. Many customers are unable to eat certain types of foods, and when they do not know what is in the dining hall before making the decision and effort to enter, they have to resort to the same salad bar repeatedly.</p>
				<p>Our user research shows that, for many dining hall customers, knowing what food is in the dining hall beforehand is critical to that user’s decision to even eat at that location either due to dietary or monetary restrictions. Many customers are unable to eat certain types of foods, and when they do not know what is in the dining hall before making the decision and effort to enter, they have to resort to the same salad bar repeatedly.</p>
				<p>Labelling is also an issue for those with restrictions. The customers we reviewed complained that the signs currently in place have tiny font that makes it hard for them to see. Not only are the signs hard to see, they are sometimes out of place, making it potentially hazardous for customers with allergies to consume them. Customers we interviewed often showed an interest in knowing the nutritional value of what they were eating but were unable to due to the small and difficult to see cards. They also provide little information outside of food allergy ingredients.</p>
        		<p>  Other times, there are monetary restrictions in how customers attend a dining hall. For example, Babson College offers two meal plans: unlimited or 10-meal weeks. For diners who are limited to 10 meals, knowing that the dining hall has quality and desirable food may affect whether these people elect to eat at that location or not. Unfortunately, it is often not easy for these students to know whether or not there is appealing food available, and they may waste one of their meals only to discover they, also, must resort to the salad bar. </p>
        		<p> Other users are interested in eating healthy and have difficulty finding healthy options in the dining hall. These users need to be able to know what food is going to be in the dining hall for similar reasons as to those who have dietary restrictions.</p>
       			<p>  Most customers also do not give feedback to dining hall staff. Comment cards are located in inconvenient locations away from where they go after eating their food. Some are also afraid of talking to the dining hall staff, thinking that they are scary.</p>
       			<p> Dining hall staff face the issue of general negative feedback when they receive them, such as,”The food sucks.” It is uninformative and they do not believe that it can apply to everything. Since they serve the masses, it is more difficult for them to make serving food as easy for small minorities. They are also busy, so individual issues are less of a priority than those that affect a lot of customers.</p>
        		<p><b>We are proposing to the solve the problem of getting quality, consumable food available for customers to eat at college/university dining halls.</b></p>

				<h2>WHO MATTERS</h2>
				<p><b>On Campus Students</b>: They pay for the food and have an impact on how the overall college is perceived based on their experience. If they are not satisfied, they could move off campus, lowering activity within the college campus or worse, sue the dining hall for issues that can come up. They think that it is frustrating when they do not have consumable food available to them and disappointing when the consumable food is not good.</p>
       			<p><b>Dining Hall Staff</b>: Their interactions with customers affect their morale and how they prepare and serve food. If their customers are happy with the food, it is evident compared to customers who do not like the food. They think that there is always consumable food available, but customers may have to put in some effort toward getting them. For comment cards, they dislike general negative comments such as, “The food sucks,” and want specific information for constructive feedback so they know how to improve in the future. </p>

				<h2>SOLVING THE PROBLEM</h2>
				<p>To address the problems we discovered we need break them down and analyze what we would require to formulate a solution. </p>
        		<p>The first problem we could address is the inaccessibility of the dining hall menu. We would need to ensure that the user has easy access to the dining hall menu before taking the time and effort to go to the dining hall. We know from research that there is a menu website, but talking to users has shown that no one takes the time to use it if they even know it exists. A viable solution to this problem is making the menu’s barrier of use significantly lower.</p>
       			<p>Our solution would ideally also address the issue of inefficient and inaccurate food labelling. Meals in the dining hall are often labelled with small and difficult to see labels and we received several comments from our interviewees that they would prefer easily knowing what they are eating. We also have anecdotal evidence that it is not uncommon for the foods to be blatantly mislabeled. This problem is closely related to letting people with dietary restrictions know what is available for them to eat. To resolve both problems we would need to make food information easily accessible and accurate.</p>
        		<p>One of our most prominent complaints was the lack of and easily accessible way of providing feedback to the dining hall staff. We would need to design an easy to use feedback interface with a low barrier of effort to resolve this problem. </p>
        		<p>  Besides solving the needs of customers, the dining hall staff would receive more clear feedback from the customers about the food that they produce. This would enable them to easily make changes to improve the dining hall experience which may, in itself, resolve other dining hall issues.</p>

				<h2>ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE</h2>
        		<p>  Joe, one of the students we interviewed, talked about an experience he had with mislabeled food. One day, in the dining hall, he decided to get some soup. Unfortunately, the vegetarian and non-vegetarian soups were mislabeled. Joe accidentally took the non-vegetarian soup, thinking there was no meat in it. Only after taking a sip of the soup did he realize that he just ate meat. As a vegetarian, he was angry at the situation. He went and complained to the dining hall, but regularly noticed the problem of mislabeled food from then on. Now, Joe always asks various dining hall staff whether a dish is vegetarian, and doesn’t trust the dish labels. Joe’s story exhibits the issues in the dining hall labeling system.</p>
        		<p> Another student we talked to, Rick, recounted an experience when he found a piece of plastic in his soup. When he found a piece of plastic in his soup, he didn’t really know who to tell. He ended up walking into the dining hall and found someone leaving the dishwashing room. He then told the staff member about the plastic. At first the staff member was disbelieving, but after she saw the plastic, she just said “Okay” and took the plastic and walked off. Rick went back to his soup, unsure whether more plastic would be found. He also was not sure what the dining hall did with the information. For all he knew, the staff member just threw away the plastic and her boss never found out about it. This situation highlights the need for a system to give feedback to the dining hall. As it is currently, the system relies on comment cards and word of mouth, both of which can be slow and ineffective in inducing change. </p>
